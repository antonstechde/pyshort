# Here is how to set up the whole Website and Stuff
- You have to host 3 Things, the API as Explained in api.md and the two Websites (Mobile and Desktop) 
- I would strongly recommend you using a setup with a Reverse Proxy like the [nginxproxymanager](https://nginxproxymanager.com) and a Webhosting Software like Nginx or Apache
- You will also need some Regex Redirecting via a .htaccess or however you can do it look at [the Readme](https://github.com/antonstechde/pyshort/blob/master/README.md) if you need help
- You will also have to edit the Stuff in the js File that it creates the Shorts with your API, but I think that's obvious
